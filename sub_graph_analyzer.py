class SubGraphAnalyzer:

        """
        Initialize the SubGraphAnalyzer instance with the given subgraph.

        This constructor method sets up the SubGraphAnalyzer instance with the provided subgraph and initializes an empty partition dictionary.

        Args:
            subgraph (networkx.Graph): A NetworkX subgraph representing the portion of the graph on which community detection will be performed.

        Returns:
            None

        Example:
            >>> import networkx as nx
            >>> subgraph = nx.Graph()
            >>> sga = SubGraphAnalyzer(subgraph)

        Note:
            - The `subgraph` parameter is expected to be a NetworkX graph representing the portion of the original graph on which 
                community detection will be performed.
            - After initialization, the `partition` dictionary will be used to store the community assignments for nodes in the subgraph.
